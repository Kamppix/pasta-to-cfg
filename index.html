    <h1>Pasta to CFG</h1>
    <p>
      This page converts long texts into CFG files compatible with games such as
      Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. These CFG files create a command alias
      which, when called repeatedly (e.g. with a keybind set with
      <code>bind &lt;key&gt; &lt;alias&gt;</code>), outputs the entire text into
      the game's chat, in chunks. <strong>Note:</strong> if the command is
      called too fast, the server will most likely throttle the message rate,
      resulting in some chunks going missing.

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head.</textarea><br/>
